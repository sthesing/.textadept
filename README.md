# .textadept
Config files for the [Textadept Editor](https://foicica.com/textadept/).

Most of these settings are highly personalized, maybe they are of some use to
other people (if only as an example of bad lua code ðŸ˜‰). 

My field is Social Science, so this makes extensive use of snippets in LaTeX 
and Markdown.
I write mainly in German, so a lot of stuff is only useful in German Academia.

## Submodules
### textadept-themes
I use the textadept-themes repo of rgieseke:
https://github.com/rgieseke/textadept-themes.git

But these config files can be used without it. Just add a directory called 
"themes" in your Textadept-userhome and make sure the themefile referenced in
init.lua is present, there.
