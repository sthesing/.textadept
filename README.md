Config files for the Textadept Editor

Most of these settings are highly personalized, maybe they are of some use to
other people (if only as an example of bad lua code ðŸ˜‰). 

My field is Social Science, so this makes extensive use of snippets in LaTeX 
and Markdown.

## Submodules
I use the textadept-themes repo of rgieseke:
https://github.com/rgieseke/textadept-themes.git

But these config files can be used without it. Just add a directory called 
"themes" in your Textadept-userhome and make sure the themefile referenced in
init.lua is present, there.
