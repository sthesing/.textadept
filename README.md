# .textadept
Config files for the [Textadept Editor](https://foicica.com/textadept/).

Most of these settings are highly personalized, maybe they are of some use to
other people (if only as an example of bad lua code ðŸ˜‰). 

My field is Social Science, so this makes extensive use of snippets in LaTeX 
and Markdown.
I write mainly in German, so a lot of stuff is only useful in German Academia.

## No more Submodules

I used to have submodules in here, but managing them as submodules was to much
of a hassel for just a few files. So I removed them and manage the respective
files manually.

But just for credit, I can really recommend this stuff and still use it, just 
no longer as submodules.

### textadept-themes

- Just add a directory called "themes" in your Textadept-userhome and make 
  sure the themefile referenced in your `init.lua` is present, there.
